# Savvy Sapian

* **Savvy Sapian is a location-based game that rewards adventurous arts lovers.** 
- Savvy Sapian is inspired by Pokemon-Go. My goal is to give people the same feeling of light-hearted exploration when visiting cultural events in NYC. Players will gain points for participating in art and culture events in NYC. Participation will be tracked by geolocation. Top players will be ranked and eventually will be rewarded with private events where they can meet artists, meet other engaged users, win free tickets to events, or win art etc.

* **User Stories** 
As an arts-lover I want to plan and track my cultural adventures.
As an arts-newbie I want to know which cultural events will match my interests and meet people with similar interests.

* **Technologies**. 
This app will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Artbeat's API, Express, React, and Geolocation.
I plan to include User comments and OAuth.

* **Anticipated Design Tools** CSS, Bulma and D3.

* **Heroku Deployment** Will do.
