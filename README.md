# Savvy Sapian

* **Savvy Sapian is a location-based game that gives adventurous arts lovers info on art events nearby.** 
- Savvy Sapian's goal is to give people the feeling of light-hearted exploration when visiting cultural events in NYC.
---

* **User Stories** 
As an arts-lover I want to look up my favorite art and get a quick overview of any arts events in my area.

* **Technologies**. 
This app  uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Artsy's API (json) Artbeat's API (xml), Express.js, React.js, and GoogleMap API.
I plan to include User comments and OAuth.


* **Heroku Deployment**

## MVP
- The MVP allows users to find artworks and events near their geolocation.

## Reach Goals
- MeetUp and GoogleCalendar API integration.
- Event notifications as a React Native app.
- Socket.io chat feature in event page so players can interact.
- Sketch plugin for drawing.

## Timeline(s)
- MVP timeline is one week. Reach Goal is 6 months.

## Foreseen Improvements
- Need to improve design abilities using Bulma for UI and D3 for maps.
- Navigating the API data took longer than anticipated. Need to get a bit deeper for more information regarding events. Artsy data was not very helpful. Will look into other data (wikisearch, google arts and culture, etc) for future improvements.
