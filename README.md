# Culture Catch

* **Culture Catch is a location-based game that rewards adventurous arts lovers** 

* **User stories** 
As an arts-lover I want to plan and track my cultural adventures.
As a culture-newbie I want to know which cultural events will match my interests and meet people with similar interests.

* **Technologies**. 
This app will use HTML, CSS, Artbeat's API, Express, React, and Geolocation.
I plan to include User comments and OAuth.

* **Anticipated Design Tools** CSS, Bulma and D3.

* **Heroku Deployment** Will do.

## Description
- Culture Catch is inspired by Pokemon-Go. My goal is to give people the same feeling of light-hearted exploration when visiting cultural events in NYC. Players will gain points for participating in art and culture events in NYC. Participation will be tracked by geolocation. Top players will be ranked and eventually will be rewarded with private events where they can meet artists, meet other engaged users, win free tickets to events, or win art etc.

- What your MVP looks like.
## MVP and WireFrames

## Timeline(s)

## Foressen Challenges
- Need to improve design abilities using Bulma and/or D3.
- Existing Artbeat API is lacking in data (summers are slow), may need to scrape data together from other places.
